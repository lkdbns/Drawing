# Drawing
A simple script to demonstrate software design patterns. It records commands and keeps track of an imaginary scene.

This project has a list of commands ranging from creating a shape to undoing the previous command. The "Drawing" type commands do not actually render any image, but record in text format the current scene that has been drawn. The project includes a sample input to simulate all the scripts commands.
